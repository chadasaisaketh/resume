    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Chada Sai Saketh, currently in my 4th year of B.Tech in Computer Science. I’m really focused on becoming an excellent software engineer and have been working hard to improve my skills in areas like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Computer Networks, Operating Systems, DBMS, and System Design. I also enjoy solving competitive programming problems to enhance my problem-solving abilities.

        I’m currently doing an internship at DBS DTI, and I make sure to balance my work there with personal projects, like teaching Python to younger students. I’ve set myself a four-month goal to become the best I can in software engineering, dedicating time each day to study and practice.</p>
